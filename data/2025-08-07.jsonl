Many deep\nlearning technologies are being employed to quickly and automatically classify\nimages. However, most of the time, the resolution of these microscopic pictures\nis quite low, which might make it difficult to classify them correctly. Some\npicture improvement techniques, such as image super-resolution, are being\nutilized to improve the resolution of the photos to get around this issue. The\nsuggested study uses large image dimension upscaling to investigate how\npicture-enhancing approaches affect classification performance. The study\nspecifically looks at how deep learning models may be able to understand more\ncomplex visual information by capturing subtler morphological changes when\nimage resolution is increased using cutting-edge techniques. The model may\nlearn from standard and augmented data since the improved images are\nincorporated into the training process. This dual method seeks to comprehend\nthe impact of image resolution on model performance and enhance classification\naccuracy. A well-known model for picture categorization is used to conduct\nextensive testing and thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of this approach.\nThis research intends to create more efficient image identification algorithms\ncustomized to a particular dataset of white blood cells by understanding the\ntrade-offs between ordinary and enhanced images."}

When these\noutputs converge, PAIRS bypasses external retrieval entirely, dramatically\nimproving the RAG system's efficiency. For divergent cases, PAIRS activates a\ndual-path retrieval (DPR) process guided by both the original query and\nself-generated contextual signals, followed by an Adaptive Information\nSelection (AIS) module that filters documents through weighted similarity to\nboth sources. This simple yet effective approach can not only enhance\nefficiency by eliminating unnecessary retrievals but also improve accuracy\nthrough contextually guided retrieval and adaptive information selection.\nExperimental results on six question-answering (QA) benchmarks show that PAIRS\nreduces retrieval costs by around 25% (triggering for only 75% of queries)\nwhile still improving accuracy-achieving +1.1% EM and +1.0% F1 over prior\nbaselines on average."}

Experiments on two datasets show that a few-shot setting\nconsistently improves classification accuracy compared to a zero-shot setting.\nWhile a traditional machine learning model achieves high accuracy on a dataset\nwith a shallow hierarchy, LLMs, especially DH strategy, tend to outperform the\nmachine learning model on a dataset with a deeper hierarchy. API costs increase\nsignificantly due to the higher input tokens required for deeper label\nhierarchies on DH strategy. These results emphasize the trade-off between\naccuracy improvement and the computational cost of prompt strategy. These\nfindings highlight the potential of black box LLMs for HTC while underscoring\nthe need to carefully select a prompt strategy to balance performance and cost."}

Deep\nlearning models, on the other hand, have been shown to be highly vulnerable to\nminor (adversarial) perturbations of the input, which manage to drastically\nchange a model's output and simultaneously expose its reliance on spurious\ncorrelations. In this work, we investigate whether inherently interpretable\ndeep models, i.e., deep models that were designed to focus more on meaningful\nand interpretable features, are more robust to irrelevant perturbations in the\ndata, compared to their black-box counterparts. We test our hypothesis by\ncomparing the robustness of an interpretable and a black-box music emotion\nrecognition (MER) model when challenged with adversarial examples. Furthermore,\nwe include an adversarially trained model, which is optimised to be more\nrobust, in the comparison. Our results indicate that inherently more\ninterpretable models can indeed be more robust than their black-box\ncounterparts, and achieve similar levels of robustness as adversarially trained\nmodels, at lower computational cost."}

However,\ntraditional GFMs primarily focus on transferring node features from various\ndomains into a unified representation space but often lack structural\ncross-domain generalization. To address this, we introduce GraphProp, which\nemphasizes structural generalization. The training process of GraphProp\nconsists of two main phases. First, we train a structural GFM by predicting\ngraph invariants. Since graph invariants are properties of graphs that depend\nonly on the abstract structure, not on particular labellings or drawings of the\ngraph, this structural GFM has a strong ability to capture the abstract\nstructural information and provide discriminative graph representations\ncomparable across diverse domains. In the second phase, we use the\nrepresentations given by the structural GFM as positional encodings to train a\ncomprehensive GFM. This phase utilizes domain-specific node attributes and\ngraph labels to further improve cross-domain node feature generalization.

This phenomenon motivates us to systematically investigate the role of\ntraining data in hallucination. We introduce a new benchmark, POPEv2, which\nconsists of counterfactual images collected from the training data of LVLMs\nwith certain objects masked. Through comprehensive evaluation on POPEv2, we\nfind that current LVLMs suffer from training bias: they fail to fully leverage\ntheir training data and hallucinate more frequently on images seen during\ntraining. Specifically, they perform poorly on counterfactual images, often\nincorrectly answering ``Yes'' to questions about masked objects. To understand\nthis issue, we conduct probing experiments on the models' internal components,\nrevealing that this training bias is primarily located in the language modeling\n(LM) head. Based on these findings, we propose Obliviate, an efficient and\nlightweight unlearning method designed to mitigate object hallucination via\ntraining bias unlearning. Obliviate identifies the discrepancy between\nground-truth labels and model outputs on the training data as a proxy for bias\nand adopts a parameter- and data-efficient fine-tuning strategy that only\nupdates the LM head.

While only reusing the training data and updating approximately 2\\%\nof the parameters, Obliviate significantly reduces hallucination across both\ndiscriminative and generative tasks.

Initial experiments reveal that embeddings from standard\nextractors (e.g., ResNet50, Sentence-Bert) enhance performance, but rely on\nmodality-specific encoders and ad hoc fusion strategies that lack control over\ncross-modal alignment.

We explore how the neural approach's\nreliance on nonlinear, stochastic processes fundamentally differs from symbolic\ncomputational paradigms, creating systems whose macro-level behaviours cannot\nbe analytically derived from micro-level neuron activities. Through analysis of\nscaling laws, grokking phenomena, and phase transitions in model capabilities,\nI demonstrate that emergent abilities arise from the complex dynamics of highly\nsensitive nonlinear systems rather than simply from parameter scaling alone.

I argue that these systems exhibit genuine emergent\nproperties analogous to those found in other complex natural phenomena, where\nsystemic capabilities emerge from cooperative interactions among simple\ncomponents without being reducible to their individual behaviours. The paper\nconcludes that understanding LLM capabilities requires recognising DNNs as a\nnew domain of complex dynamical systems governed by universal principles of\nemergence, similar to those operating in physics, chemistry, and biology.

Although most existing methods address only one of\nthese challenges, we introduce the Accept-Reject Lasso (ARL), a novel approach\nthat resolves this dilemma. ARL operationalizes an Accept-Reject framework\nthrough a fine-grained analysis of feature selection across data subsets. This\nframework is designed to partition the output of an ensemble method into\nbeneficial and detrimental components through fine-grained analysis. The\nfundamental challenge for Lasso is that inter-variable correlation obscures the\ntrue sources of information. ARL tackles this by first using clustering to\nidentify distinct subset structures within the data. It then analyzes Lasso's\nbehavior across these subsets to differentiate between true and spurious\ncorrelations. For truly correlated features, which induce multicollinearity,\nARL tends to select a single representative feature and reject the rest to\nensure model stability. Conversely, for features linked by spurious\ncorrelations, which may vanish in certain subsets, ARL accepts those that Lasso\nmight have incorrectly omitted. The distinct patterns arising from true versus\nspurious correlations create a divisible separation. By setting an appropriate\nthreshold, our framework can effectively distinguish between these two\nphenomena, thereby maximizing the inclusion of informative variables while\nminimizing the introduction of detrimental ones.

Supplementary materials, including codes, task\nagent setup, trace outputs, and annotated examples of coordination failures and\nreasoning behaviors, are available at:\nhttps://byc-sophie.github.io/mas-to-mars/."}

Yet, a complete understanding of why these models hallucinate\nmore than general purpose language models is missing. In this investigative\nstudy, we systematicallyexplore reasoning failures of contemporary language\nmodels on multi-hop question answering tasks. We introduce a novel, nuanced\nerror categorization framework that examines failures across three critical\ndimensions: the diversity and uniqueness of source documents involved (\"hops\"),\ncompleteness in capturing relevant information (\"coverage\"), and cognitive\ninefficiency (\"overthinking\"). Through rigorous hu-man annotation, supported by\ncomplementary automated metrics, our exploration uncovers intricate error\npatterns often hidden by accuracy-centric evaluations. This investigative\napproach provides deeper insights into the cognitive limitations of current\nmodels and offers actionable guidance toward enhancing reasoning fidelity,\ntransparency, and robustness in future language modeling efforts."}
