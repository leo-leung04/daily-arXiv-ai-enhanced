However, a persistent and\nsubstantial gap remains between algorithm design and hardware implementation.\nBridging this gap traditionally requires extensive domain expertise and\ntime-consuming manual development, due to fundamental mismatches between\nhigh-level programming languages like MATLAB and hardware description languages\n(HDLs) such as Verilog-in terms of memory access patterns, data processing\nmanners, and datatype representations. To address this challenge, we propose\nA2HCoder: a Hierarchical Algorithm-to-HDL Coding Agent, powered by large\nlanguage models (LLMs), designed to enable agile and reliable\nalgorithm-to-hardware translation. A2HCoder introduces a hierarchical framework\nthat enhances both robustness and interpretability while suppressing common\nhallucination issues in LLM-generated code. In the horizontal dimension,\nA2HCoder decomposes complex algorithms into modular functional blocks,\nsimplifying code generation and improving consistency. In the vertical\ndimension, instead of relying on end-to-end generation, A2HCoder performs\nstep-by-step, fine-grained translation, leveraging external toolchains such as\nMATLAB and Vitis HLS for debugging and circuit-level synthesis. This structured\nprocess significantly mitigates hallucinations and ensures hardware-level\ncorrectness. We validate A2HCoder through a real-world deployment case in the\n5G wireless communication domain, demonstrating its practicality, reliability,\nand deployment efficiency."}

The average RBP across all 31\nchannels, as well as individual brain regions, is analyzed.

The performance of classifying MAT versus HC is\nlower than that of MBT versus HC, suggesting that the efficacy of rTMS can be\nvalidated using RF with gamma RBP. Furthermore, the gamma RBP recorded by the\nTP10 and CP2 channels dominates the classification task of MBT versus HC when\nreceiving METH-related image cues. The gamma RBP during exposure to\nMETH-related cues can serve as a biomarker for distinguishing between MBT and\nHC and for evaluating the effectiveness of rTMS.

In such settings, algorithmic recourse aims to provide individuals\nwith actionable and minimally costly steps to reverse unfavorable AI-driven\ndecisions. While existing research predominantly focuses on single-individual\n(i.e., seeker) and single-model (i.e., provider) scenarios, real-world\napplications often involve multiple interacting stakeholders. Optimizing\noutcomes for seekers under an individual welfare approach overlooks the\ninherently multi-agent nature of real-world systems, where individuals interact\nand compete for limited resources. To address this, we introduce a novel\nframework for multi-agent algorithmic recourse that accounts for multiple\nrecourse seekers and recourse providers. We model this many-to-many interaction\nas a capacitated weighted bipartite matching problem, where matches are guided\nby both recourse cost and provider capacity. Edge weights, reflecting recourse\ncosts, are optimized for social welfare while quantifying the welfare gap\nbetween individual welfare and this collectively feasible outcome.

A soft gating mechanism fuses these representations to form\ncontextualized, content-aware embeddings of each post. To model temporal\nevolution, E-CaTCH segments events into overlapping time windows and uses a\ntrend-aware LSTM, enhanced with semantic shift and momentum signals, to encode\nnarrative progression over time. Classification is performed at the event\nlevel, enabling better alignment with real-world misinformation dynamics. To\naddress class imbalance and promote stable learning, the model integrates\nadaptive class weighting, temporal consistency regularization, and hard-example\nmining. The total loss is aggregated across all events. Extensive experiments\non Fakeddit, IND, and COVID-19 MISINFOGRAPH demonstrate that E-CaTCH\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Cross-dataset evaluations\nfurther demonstrate its robustness, generalizability, and practical\napplicability across diverse misinformation scenarios."}

Converging evidence shows that genetic\nvariants with low marginal effects (LME) play an important role in disease\ndevelopment. Despite their potential significance, discovering LME genetic\nvariants and assessing their joint association on high dimensional data (e.g.,\ngenome wide association studies) remain a great challenge. To facilitate joint\nassociation analysis among a large ensemble of LME genetic variants, we\nproposed a computationally efficient and powerful approach, which we call Trees\nAssembling Mann whitney (TAMW). Through simulation studies and an empirical\ndata application, we found that TAMW outperformed multifactor dimensionality\nreduction (MDR) and the likelihood ratio based Mann whitney approach (LRMW)\nwhen the underlying complex disease involves multiple LME loci and their\ninteractions. For instance, in a simulation with 20 interacting LME loci, TAMW\nattained a higher power (power=0.931) than both MDR (power=0.599) and LRMW\n(power=0.704). In an empirical study of 29 known Crohn's disease (CD) loci,\nTAMW also identified a stronger joint association with CD than those detected\nby MDR and LRMW. Finally, we applied TAMW to Wellcome Trust CD GWAS to conduct\na genome wide analysis. The analysis of 459K single nucleotide polymorphisms\nwas completed in 40 hours using parallel computing, and revealed a joint\nassociation predisposing to CD (p-value=2.763e-19).

GraphRAG methods\naddress this by leveraging knowledge graphs (KGs) to capture structural\nassociations, but they tend to overly rely on structural information and\nfine-grained word- or phrase-level retrieval, resulting in an underutilization\nof textual semantics. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG approach called\nHGRAG for MHQA that achieves cross-granularity integration of structural and\nsemantic information via hypergraphs.

This phenomena diminishes utility in production applications that\nrepeatedly rely on common prompt templates or applications that frequently rely\non LLMs for specific tasks (e.g. sentiment analysis, language translation).\nThrough comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that LLMs still tend to refuse\nresponses to harmful instructions when those instructions are reframed to\nappear as benign tasks. Our mechanistic analysis reveal that LLMs follow\ndistinct \"constellation\" patterns in embedding space as representations\ntraverse layers, with each task maintaining consistent trajectories that shift\npredictably between refusal and non-refusal cases. We introduce\nSafeConstellations, an inference-time trajectory-shifting approach that tracks\ntask-specific trajectory patterns and guides representations toward non-refusal\npathways. By selectively guiding model behavior only on tasks prone to\nover-refusal, and by preserving general model behavior, our method reduces\nover-refusal rates by up to 73% with minimal impact on utility-offering a\nprincipled approach to mitigating over-refusals."}

However, due to the parameter explosion and data\nsparsity issues, Bayesian network classifiers are restricted to low-order\nfeature dependency modeling, making them struggle in extrapolating the\noccurrence probabilities of complex real-world data. In this paper, we propose\na novel paradigm to design high-order Bayesian network classifiers, by learning\ndistributional representations for feature values, as what has been done in\nword embedding and graph representation learning. The learned distributional\nrepresentations are encoded with the semantic relatedness between different\nfeatures through their observed co-occurrence patterns in training data, which\nthen serve as a hallmark to extrapolate the occurrence probabilities of new\ntest samples. As a classifier design realization, we remake the K-dependence\nBayesian classifier (KDB) by extending it into a neural version, i.e.,\nNeuralKDB, where a novel neural network architecture is designed to learn\ndistributional representations of feature values and parameterize the\nconditional probabilities between interdependent features. A stochastic\ngradient descent based algorithm is designed to train the NeuralKDB model\nefficiently.

While current VQA benchmarks\nconsider a limited set of object property attributes like size, they typically\nblend perception and reasoning, and lack representativeness in terms of\nreasoning and image categories. To this end, we introduce a systematic\nevaluation framework with images of three representative types, three reasoning\nlevels of increasing complexity, and four object property dimensions driven by\nprior work on commonsense reasoning. We develop a procedure to instantiate this\nbenchmark into ORBIT, a multi-level reasoning VQA benchmark for object\nproperties comprising 360 images paired with a total of 1,080 count-based\nquestions. Experiments with 12 state-of-the-art VLMs in zero-shot settings\nreveal significant limitations compared to humans, with the best-performing\nmodel only reaching 40\\% accuracy. VLMs struggle particularly with realistic\n(photographic) images, counterfactual reasoning about physical and functional\nproperties, and higher counts. ORBIT points to the need to develop methods for\nscalable benchmarking, generalize annotation guidelines, and explore additional\nreasoning VLMs. We make the ORBIT benchmark and the experimental code available\nto support such endeavors."}

We argue that\nresolving this conflict requires systematically decoupling task-specific\nlearning signals throughout the training pipeline. To this end, we introduce\nCoDiEmb, a unified framework that reconciles the divergent requirements of IR\nand STS in a collaborative yet distinct manner. CoDiEmb integrates three key\ninnovations for effective joint optimization: (1) Task-specialized objectives\npaired with a dynamic sampler that forms single-task batches and balances\nper-task updates, thereby preventing gradient interference. For IR, we employ a\ncontrastive loss with multiple positives and hard negatives, augmented by\ncross-device sampling. For STS, we adopt order-aware objectives that directly\noptimize correlation and ranking consistency. (2) A delta-guided model fusion\nstrategy that computes fine-grained merging weights for checkpoints by\nanalyzing each parameter's deviation from its pre-trained initialization,\nproving more effective than traditional Model Soups. (3) An efficient,\nsingle-stage training pipeline that is simple to implement and converges\nstably.

Building on research on fairness and\ndiscrimination in AI, we investigate whether LLMs exhibit speciesist bias --\ndiscrimination based on species membership -- and how they value non-human\nanimals. We systematically examine this issue across three paradigms: (1)\nSpeciesismBench, a 1,003-item benchmark assessing recognition and moral\nevaluation of speciesist statements; (2) established psychological measures\ncomparing model responses with those of human participants; (3) text-generation\ntasks probing elaboration on, or resistance to, speciesist rationalizations.

On\npsychological measures, results were mixed: LLMs expressed slightly lower\nexplicit speciesism than people, yet in direct trade-offs they more often chose\nto save one human over multiple animals. A tentative interpretation is that\nLLMs may weight cognitive capacity rather than species per se: when capacities\nwere equal, they showed no species preference, and when an animal was described\nas more capable, they tended to prioritize it over a less capable human.

However, for many optimization problems, such as linear\nprograms (LPs), the gradient of the regret with respect to the predicted\nparameters is zero almost everywhere. Existing gradient-based DFL approaches\nfor LPs try to circumvent this issue in one of two ways: (a) smoothing the LP\ninto a differentiable optimization problem by adding a quadratic regularizer\nand then minimizing the regret directly or (b) minimizing surrogate losses that\nhave informative (sub)gradients. In this paper, we show that the former\napproach still results in zero gradients, because even after smoothing the\nregret remains constant across large regions of the parameter space. To address\nthis, we propose minimizing surrogate losses -- even when a differentiable\noptimization layer is used and regret can be minimized directly.

Further, we demonstrate that this also holds\nfor DYS-Net, a recently proposed differentiable optimization technique for LPs,\nthat computes approximate solutions and gradients through operations that can\nbe performed using feedforward neural network layers.

They are often pretrained on large corpora, and openly shared\non a model platform, such as HuggingFace. Users can then build up AI\napplications, e.g., generating media contents, by adopting pretrained T2I\nmodels and fine-tuning them on the target dataset. While public pretrained T2I\nmodels facilitate the democratization of the models, users face a new\nchallenge: which model can be best fine-tuned based on the target data domain?\nModel selection is well addressed in classification tasks, but little is known\nin (pretrained) T2I models and their performance indication on the target\ndomain. In this paper, we propose the first model selection framework, M&C,\nwhich enables users to efficiently choose a pretrained T2I model from a model\nplatform without exhaustively fine-tuning them all on the target dataset. The\ncore of M&C is a matching graph, which consists of: (i) nodes of available\nmodels and profiled datasets, and (ii) edges of model-data and data-data pairs\ncapturing the fine-tuning performance and data similarity, respectively. We\nthen build a model that, based on the inputs of model/data feature, and,\ncritically, the graph embedding feature, extracted from the matching graph,\npredicts the model achieving the best quality after fine-tuning for the target\ndomain. We evaluate M&C on choosing across ten T2I models for 32 datasets\nagainst three baselines. Our results show that M&C successfully predicts the\nbest model for fine-tuning in 61.3% of the cases and a closely performing model\nfor the rest."}

To address these challenges, we propose a\nlightweight Uncertainty Modal Modeling (UMM) framework, which integrates a\nmultimodal token mapper, synthetic modality augmentation strategy, and\ncross-modal cue interactive learner.

We report and discuss results with\nfour public datasets, IDRID, Drishti-GS, RIM-ONE-r3, and REFUGE, and a private\ndataset, GoDARTS, achieving about 96% Dice consistently across all datasets.\nOverall, our method obtains excellent performance in internal verification,\ndomain generalization and domain adaptation, and exceeds most of the\nstate-of-the-art baseline results. We discuss the results in the framework of\nthe debate about FMs as alternatives to task-specific architectures. The code\nis available at: [link to be added after the paper is accepted]"}

However, achieving efficient and high-accuracy image\nclassification in resource-constrained computational environments remains\nchallenging. This study proposes a medical image classification method based on\nan improved ConvNeXt-Tiny architecture. Through structural optimization and\nloss function design, the proposed method enhances feature extraction\ncapability and classification performance while reducing computational\ncomplexity. Specifically, the method introduces a dual global pooling (Global\nAverage Pooling and Global Max Pooling) feature fusion strategy into the\nConvNeXt-Tiny backbone to simultaneously preserve global statistical features\nand salient response information. A lightweight channel attention module,\ntermed Squeeze-and-Excitation Vector (SEVector), is designed to improve the\nadaptive allocation of channel weights while minimizing parameter overhead.\nAdditionally, a Feature Smoothing Loss is incorporated into the loss function\nto enhance intra-class feature consistency and suppress intra-class variance.\nUnder CPU-only conditions (8 threads), the method achieves a maximum\nclassification accuracy of 89.10% on the test set within 10 training epochs,\nexhibiting a stable convergence trend in loss values. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves medical image\nclassification performance in resource-limited settings, providing a feasible\nand efficient solution for the deployment and promotion of medical imaging\nanalysis models."}

Unlike\ntraditional parametric approaches, which assume a known functional form for the\ndrift, our goal here is to learn the entire drift function directly from data\nwithout strong structural assumptions, making it especially relevant in\nscientific disciplines where system dynamics are partially understood or highly\ncomplex. We cast the estimation problem as minimization of the penalized\nnegative log-likelihood functional over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space\n(RKHS). In the sparse observation regime, the presence of unobserved trajectory\nsegments makes the SDE likelihood intractable. To address this, we develop an\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm that employs a novel Sequential Monte\nCarlo (SMC) method to approximate the filtering distribution and generate Monte\nCarlo estimates of the E-step objective. The M-step then reduces to a penalized\nempirical risk minimization problem in the RKHS, whose minimizer is given by a\nfinite linear combination of kernel functions via a generalized representer\ntheorem. To control model complexity across EM iterations, we also develop a\nhybrid Bayesian variant of the algorithm that uses shrinkage priors to identify\nsignificant coefficients in the kernel expansion. We establish important\ntheoretical convergence results for both the exact and approximate EM\nsequences. The resulting EM-SMC-RKHS procedure enables accurate estimation of\nthe drift function of stochastic dynamical systems in low-data regimes and is\nbroadly applicable across domains requiring continuous-time modeling under\nobservational constraints.
