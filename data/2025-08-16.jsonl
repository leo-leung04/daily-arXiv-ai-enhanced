Here we challenge this view by\nestablishing that a fixed neural structure can operate in fundamentally\ndifferent computational modes, driven not by its structure but by the temporal\ndynamics of its input signals. We term this principle 'Dynamical Alignment'.\n  Applying this principle offers a novel resolution to the long-standing\nparadox of why brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) underperform. By\nencoding static input into controllable dynamical trajectories, we uncover a\nbimodal optimization landscape with a critical phase transition governed by\nphase space volume dynamics. A 'dissipative' mode, driven by contracting\ndynamics, achieves superior energy efficiency through sparse temporal codes. In\ncontrast, an 'expansive' mode, driven by expanding dynamics, unlocks the\nrepresentational power required for SNNs to match or even exceed their\nartificial neural network counterparts on diverse tasks, including\nclassification, reinforcement learning, and cognitive integration.\n  We find this computational advantage emerges from a timescale alignment\nbetween input dynamics and neuronal integration. This principle, in turn,\noffers a unified, computable perspective on long-observed dualities in\nneuroscience, from stability-plasticity dilemma to segregation-integration\ndynamic. It demonstrates that computation in both biological and artificial\nsystems can be dynamically sculpted by 'software' on fixed 'hardware', pointing\ntoward a potential paradigm shift for AI research: away from designing complex\nstatic architectures and toward mastering adaptive, dynamic computation\nprinciples."}

We study model-induced stochasticity, which\nquantifies the variance of a set of forecasts produced by a single model when\nthe set of inputs is fixed. Models with lower variance are more stable.\n  Recently the forecasting community has seen significant advances in forecast\naccuracy through the development of deep machine learning models for time\nseries forecasting.

Prior work has\nproposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to\nparticular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the\nemerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as\nthe generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address\nthis challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion\nmodels, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.\nWe begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive\ninfilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a\nvalid word in the target language.

Both the\noriginal and AI-adjusted definitions of entropic potential are formalized, with\nthe latter emphasizing conditional expectations to account for counterfactual\nscenarios. Applications are explored in policy evaluation, intrinsic reward\ndesign, explainable AI, and anomaly detection, highlighting the metric's\npotential to unify and strengthen uncertainty modeling in intelligent systems.\nConceptual examples illustrate its use in reinforcement learning, Bayesian\ninference, and anomaly detection, while practical considerations for\ncomputation in complex AI models are discussed. The entropic potential\nframework offers a theoretically grounded, interpretable, and versatile\napproach to managing uncertainty in AI, bridging principles from\nthermodynamics, information theory, and machine learning."}

Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting\nand analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel,\nscalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085\nphotographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period\n(2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000\nindividual markings, which were then labeled and described using\nstate-of-the-art AI tools.

With large\nfoundation models (FMs) demonstrating impressive capabilities, using FMs in FL\nthrough cost-efficient adapter tuning has become a popular approach. Given the\nrapidly evolving healthcare environment, it is crucial for individual clients\nto quickly adapt to new tasks or diseases by tuning adapters while drawing upon\npast experiences. In this work, we introduce Federated Knowledge-Enhanced\nInitialization (FedKEI), a novel framework that leverages cross-client and\ncross-task transfer from past knowledge to generate informed initializations\nfor learning new tasks with adapters. FedKEI begins with a global clustering\nprocess at the server to generalize knowledge across tasks, followed by the\noptimization of aggregation weights across clusters (inter-cluster weights) and\nwithin each cluster (intra-cluster weights) to personalize knowledge transfer\nfor each new task. To facilitate more effective learning of the inter- and\nintra-cluster weights, we adopt a bi-level optimization scheme that\ncollaboratively learns the global intra-cluster weights across clients and\noptimizes the local inter-cluster weights toward each client's task objective.\nExtensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of different modalities,\nincluding dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT, demonstrate FedKEI's\nadvantage in adapting to new diseases compared to state-of-the-art methods."}

This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a\nminority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information,\nhindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this\nchallenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the\nproblem as a federated generative data augmentation task. GraphFedMIG employs a\nhierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local\ngenerator to synthesize high-fidelity feature representations. To provide\ntailored supervision, clients are grouped into clusters, each sharing a\ndedicated discriminator. Crucially, the framework designs a mutual\ninformation-guided mechanism to steer the evolution of these client generators.\nBy calculating each client's unique informational value, this mechanism\ncorrects the local generator parameters, ensuring that subsequent rounds of\nmutual information-guided generation are focused on producing high-value,\nminority-class features. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world\ndatasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed\nGraphFedMIG compared with other baselines."}

Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes\niterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace.\nIn each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths,\nthen integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory\npool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query\nresolution. Across four challenging long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+\ntokens), ComoRAG outperforms strong RAG baselines with consistent relative\ngains up to 11% compared to the strongest baseline. Further analysis reveals\nthat ComoRAG is particularly advantageous for complex queries requiring global\ncomprehension, offering a principled, cognitively motivated paradigm for\nretrieval-based long context comprehension towards stateful reasoning.

These situations resulted in measurable levels of performance\ndegradation, i.e. telemetry updates were delayed, and computational loads were\nincreased, as a result of poor system adaptations. It was suggested to use a\nmultilayered defense-in-depth approach with memory isolation, validation of\nplanners and anomaly response systems in real-time. These findings verify that\nMAESTRO is viable in operational threat mapping, prospective risk scoring, and\nthe basis of the resilient system design.

Existing defenses, including host\nbased patching and network based filtering, are inadequate due to limited\nscalability across diverse devices, compatibility issues especially with\nembedded or legacy systems, and error prone deployment process (manual patch\nvalidation). To address these issues, we introduce REFN (Reinforcement Learning\nFrom Network), a novel framework that trains Large Language Models (LLMs) to\nautonomously generate network filters to prevent 1 day or n day exploitations.\nREFN ensures scalability by uniquely employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) driven\nby online network rewards instead of traditional Human Feedback (RLHF). REFN\nguarantees compatibility via unified deployment on edge security gateways\n(Amazon Eero). REFN provides robustness via online validation using real\nnetwork traffic. Crucially, REFN addresses three core challenges in training\nLLMs for exploit prevention: 1) expanding current LLMs limited vulnerability\nfixing expertise via Agentic RAG based Knowledge Distillation, 2) bridging\ncurrent LLMs language to network gaps through an RL From VNF Pipeline that\ntranslates language context (vulnerability description) into network\nenforcement, 3) addressing the LLM hallucination and non determinism via the\nOnline Agentic Validation that penalizes erroneous outputs. Evaluated across 22\nfamilies of 1 day or n day exploits, REFN demonstrates effectiveness (21.1\npercent higher accuracy than alternatives), efficiency (Mean Time To Patch of\n3.65 hours) and scalability (easily scale to 10K devices).

To demonstrate the potential of the data, we train LLM,\nCLIP, and LLava architectures to reason jointly about text and design targets\nand evaluate on tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC). \\ourdataset~is\nhighly effective for creating models with strong priors: in supervised\nprediction problems that use our data as pretraining, our best models with 15M\nlearnable parameters outperform larger 2B TxGemma on both regression and\nclassification TDC tasks, and perform comparably to 9B models on average.\nModels built with \\ourdataset~can be used as constraints while optimizing for\nnovel molecules in GuacaMol, resulting in proposals that are safer and nearly\nas effective. We release our dataset at\n\\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex}{huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex},\nand will provide expanded versions as available literature grows."}

We study three search strategies with an extensive set of\nexperiments, and use experiment results to inform an ensemble algorithm that\nselects a search strategy according to the characteristics of a class. Our\nfurther experiments demonstrate that this ensemble approach is more effective\nthan each individual strategy in our automated workflow for improving\nclassification models using LLMs."}

We term this principle 'Dynamical Alignment'.\n  Applying this principle offers a novel resolution to the long-standing\nparadox of why brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) underperform. By\nencoding static input into controllable dynamical trajectories, we uncover a\nbimodal optimization landscape with a critical phase transition governed by\nphase space volume dynamics. A 'dissipative' mode, driven by contracting\ndynamics, achieves superior energy efficiency through sparse temporal codes.

A key concern is\nassuring the reliability of robot perception, as perception seeds safe\ndecision-making. Failures in perception are often due to complex yet common\nenvironmental factors and can lead to accidents that erode public trust. To\naddress this concern, we introduce the SET (Self, Environment, and Target)\nPerceptual Factors Framework. We designed the framework to systematically\nanalyze how factors such as weather, occlusion, or sensor limitations\nnegatively impact perception. To achieve this, the framework employs SET State\nTrees to categorize where such factors originate and SET Factor Trees to model\nhow these sources and factors impact perceptual tasks like object detection or\npose estimation. Next, we develop Perceptual Factor Models using both trees to\nquantify the uncertainty for a given task. Our framework aims to promote\nrigorous safety assurances and cultivate greater public understanding and trust\nin autonomous systems by offering a transparent and standardized method for\nidentifying, modeling, and communicating perceptual risks."}

While much has been done in the social and behavioural literature\nto characterise the features and consequences of subjective self-disclosure,\nlittle work has been done thus far to develop computational systems that are\nable to accurately model it. Even less work has been done that attempts to\nmodel specifically how human interactants self-disclose with robotic partners.\nIt is becoming more pressing as we require social robots to work in conjunction\nwith and establish relationships with humans in various social settings. In\nthis paper, our aim is to develop a custom multimodal attention network based\non models from the emotion recognition literature, training this model on a\nlarge self-collected self-disclosure video corpus, and constructing a new loss\nfunction, the scale preserving cross entropy loss, that improves upon both\nclassification and regression versions of this problem. Our results show that\nthe best performing model, trained with our novel loss function, achieves an F1\nscore of 0.83, an improvement of 0.48 from the best baseline model. This result\nmakes significant headway in the aim of allowing social robots to pick up on an\ninteraction partner's self-disclosures, an ability that will be essential in\nsocial robots with social cognition."}

This creates a need to improve smaller\nmodels, yet existing post-training methods are designed for single-turn\ninteractions and cannot handle credit assignment in multi-step agentic tasks.\nTo address this, we introduce Multi-Step Group-Relative Policy Optimization\n(MS-GRPO), a new algorithm for post-training LLM agents, grounded in formal\nText-Mediated Stochastic Game (TSMG) and Language-Agent Policy (LAP)\nframeworks. For credit assignment, MS-GRPO attributes the entire cumulative\nepisode reward to each individual episode step. We supplement this algorithm\nwith a novel absolute-advantage-weighted episode sampling strategy that we show\nimproves training performance. We evaluate our approach by post-training a\n3-billion parameter model on Snake and Frozen Lake. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat the method is effective in improving decision-making performance: our\npost-trained 3B parameter model outperforms a 72B parameter baseline by 50% on\nthe Frozen Lake task.

These dynamic\ndialogues enable adaptive attack strategies that can cause severe privacy\nviolations, yet their evolving nature makes it difficult to anticipate and\ndiscover sophisticated vulnerabilities manually. To tackle this problem, we\npresent a search-based framework that alternates between improving attacker and\ndefender instructions by simulating privacy-critical agent interactions. Each\nsimulation involves three roles: data subject, data sender, and data recipient.\nWhile the data subject's behavior is fixed, the attacker (data recipient)\nattempts to extract sensitive information from the defender (data sender)\nthrough persistent and interactive exchanges. To explore this interaction space\nefficiently, our search algorithm employs LLMs as optimizers, using parallel\nsearch with multiple threads and cross-thread propagation to analyze simulation\ntrajectories and iteratively propose new instructions.

To address this, we introduce ToonComposer, a generative model that\nunifies inbetweening and colorization into a single post-keyframing stage.\nToonComposer employs a sparse sketch injection mechanism to provide precise\ncontrol using keyframe sketches.
