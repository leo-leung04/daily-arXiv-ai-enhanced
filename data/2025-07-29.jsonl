The proposed platform utilizes cutting\nedge LLM capabilities including semantic understanding, contextual reasoning,\nand cross-domain knowledge extraction to interpret problem statements and\nretrieve high-quality, sustainable solutions. The system processes unstructured\npatent texts, such as claims and technical descriptions, and systematically\nextracts potential innovations aligned with the given problem context. These\nsolutions are then algorithmically organized under standardized technical\ncategories and subcategories to ensure clarity and relevance across\ninterdisciplinary domains. In addition to patent analysis, the platform\nintegrates commercial intelligence by identifying validated market solutions\nand active organizations addressing similar challenges. This combined insight\nsourced from both intellectual property and real world product data enables R&D\nteams to assess not only technical novelty but also feasibility, scalability,\nand sustainability. The result is a comprehensive, AI driven scouting engine\nthat reduces manual effort, accelerates innovation cycles, and enhances\ndecision making in complex R&D environments."}

In this paper, we hypothesize\nthat while the increase in dimensions has been a key advantage, it may lead to\nemergent problems as well. These problems emerge as the linear structures in\nthe activation space can be exploited, in the form of activation engineering,\nto circumvent its safety alignment. Through detailed visualizations of linear\nsubspaces associated with different concepts, such as safety, across various\nmodel scales, we show that the curse of high-dimensional representations\nuniquely impacts LLMs. Further substantiating our claim, we demonstrate that\nprojecting the representations of the model onto a lower dimensional subspace\ncan preserve sufficient information for alignment while avoiding those linear\nstructures. Empirical results confirm that such dimensional reduction\nsignificantly reduces susceptibility to jailbreaking through representation\nengineering. Building on our empirical validations, we provide theoretical\ninsights into these linear jailbreaking methods relative to a model's hidden\ndimensions.

In addition, we investigate a price manipulation strategy\nusing a variational auto encoder-generative adversarial network (VAE-GAN)\nmodel, which allows utilities to adjust price signals in a way that induces\nfinancial losses for the prosumers. Our results show that under adversarial\npricing, heterogeneous prosumer groups, particularly those lacking generation\ncapabilities, incur financial losses. The same outcome holds across LEMs of\ndifferent sizes. As the market size increases, trading stabilizes and fairness\nimproves through emergent cooperation among agents."}

This work\nconjectures that the same feature-learning dynamics which facilitate\ngeneralization in grokking also underlie the ability to overwrite previous\nlearned features as well, and methods which accelerate grokking by facilitating\nfeature-learning dynamics are promising candidates for addressing primacy bias\nin non-stationary learning problems. We then propose a straightforward method\nto induce feature-learning dynamics as needed throughout training by increasing\nthe effective learning rate, i.e. the ratio between parameter and update norms.\nWe show that this approach both facilitates feature-learning and improves\ngeneralization in a variety of settings, including grokking, warm-starting\nneural network training, and reinforcement learning tasks."}

To rigorously evaluate the\nNL2FOL-to-reasoning pipeline, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework\ncomprising three custom metrics: conversion score, reasoning score, and\nSpearman rho score, which collectively capture the quality of logical\ntranslation and its downstream impact on reasoning accuracy.\n  Empirical results on domain-specific datasets demonstrate that Text-JEPA\nachieves competitive performance with significantly lower computational\noverhead compared to larger LLM-based systems. Our findings highlight the\npotential of structured, interpretable reasoning frameworks for building\nefficient and explainable QA systems in specialized domains."}

We analyze the stage-wise\ndynamics of attention during training: attention scores between a query token\nand its target features grow rapidly in the early phase, then gradually\nconverge to one, while attention to irrelevant features decays more slowly and\nexhibits oscillatory behavior. Our analysis introduces new proof techniques\nthat explicitly characterize how the nature of general non-degenerate\nL-Lipschitz task functions affects attention weights. Specifically, we identify\nthat the Lipschitz constant L of nonlinear function classes as a key factor\ngoverning the convergence dynamics of transformers in ICL. Leveraging these\ninsights, for two distinct regimes depending on whether L is below or above a\nthreshold, we derive different time bounds to guarantee near-zero prediction\nerror. Notably, despite the convergence time depending on the underlying task\nfunctions, we prove that query tokens consistently attend to prompt tokens with\nhighly relevant features at convergence, demonstrating the ICL capability of\ntransformers for unseen functions."}

Materials and Methods: We curated a\ntraining dataset of 6,000 abdominal MRI/CT reports (2005-2024) from 5,134\npatients that described PCLs. Labels were generated by GPT-4o using\nchain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to extract PCL and main pancreatic duct\nfeatures.

But can these systems be trusted to follow deployment policies in\nrealistic environments, especially under attack? To investigate, we ran the\nlargest public red-teaming competition to date, targeting 22 frontier AI agents\nacross 44 realistic deployment scenarios.

We use these results to build the Agent Red Teaming\n(ART) benchmark - a curated set of high-impact attacks - and evaluate it across\n19 state-of-the-art models. Nearly all agents exhibit policy violations for\nmost behaviors within 10-100 queries, with high attack transferability across\nmodels and tasks. Importantly, we find limited correlation between agent\nrobustness and model size, capability, or inference-time compute, suggesting\nthat additional defenses are needed against adversarial misuse.

While approximate unlearning algorithms offer\nefficient alternatives to full retraining, this work reveals that they fail to\nadequately protect the privacy of unlearned data. In particular, these\nalgorithms introduce implicit residuals which facilitate privacy attacks\ntargeting at unlearned data. We observe that these residuals persist regardless\nof model architectures, parameters, and unlearning algorithms, exposing a new\nattack surface beyond conventional output-based leakage. Based on this insight,\nwe propose the Reminiscence Attack (ReA), which amplifies the correlation\nbetween residuals and membership privacy through targeted fine-tuning\nprocesses. ReA achieves up to 1.90x and 1.12x higher accuracy than prior\nattacks when inferring class-wise and sample-wise membership, respectively. To\nmitigate such residual-induced privacy risk, we develop a dual-phase\napproximate unlearning framework that first eliminates deep-layer unlearned\ndata traces and then enforces convergence stability to prevent models from\n\"pseudo-convergence\", where their outputs are similar to retrained models but\nstill preserve unlearned residuals. Our framework works for both classification\nand generation tasks. Experimental evaluations confirm that our approach\nmaintains high unlearning efficacy, while reducing the adaptive privacy attack\naccuracy to nearly random guess, at the computational cost of 2-12% of full\nretraining from scratch."}

To address the unique challenges of humanoid robots, we overcome\nissues such as kinematic interference and occlusion, and establish an effective\nsensor layout strategy. Furthermore, we have developed the first panoramic\noccupancy dataset specifically for humanoid robots, offering a valuable\nbenchmark and resource for future research and development in this domain. The\nnetwork architecture incorporates multi-modal feature fusion and temporal\ninformation integration to ensure robust perception. Overall, Humanoid\nOccupancy delivers effective environmental perception for humanoid robots and\nestablishes a technical foundation for standardizing universal visual modules,\npaving the way for the widespread deployment of humanoid robots in complex\nreal-world scenarios."}

Fine-tuning techniques have\nbeen developed to adapt pre-trained LLMs to specific tasks, such as APR, and\nenhance their performance at far lower computational costs than training from\nscratch. In this study, we empirically investigate the impact of various\nfine-tuning techniques on the performance of LLMs used for APR. Our experiments\nprovide insights into the performance of a selection of state-of-the-art LLMs\npre-trained on code. The evaluation is done on three popular APR benchmarks\n(i.e., QuixBugs, Defects4J and HumanEval-Java) and considers six different LLMs\nwith varying parameter sizes (resp. CodeGen, CodeT5, StarCoder, DeepSeekCoder,\nBloom, and CodeLlama-2). We consider three training regimens: no fine-tuning,\nfull fine-tuning, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using LoRA and\nIA3. We observe that full fine-tuning techniques decrease the benchmarking\nperformance of various models due to different data distributions and\noverfitting. By using parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, we restrict\nmodels in the amount of trainable parameters and achieve better results.\n  Keywords: large language models, automated program repair,\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning, AI4Code, AI4SE, ML4SE."}

Many existing clustering algorithms suffer from\ncritical limitations: they often require careful parameter tuning, exhibit high\ncomputational complexity, lack interpretability, or yield suboptimal accuracy,\nespecially when applied to large-scale datasets. In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel clustering approach based on meta-learning. Our approach eliminates the\nneed for parameter optimization while achieving accuracy that outperforms\nstate-of-the-art clustering techniques. The proposed technique leverages a few\npre-clustered samples to guide the clustering process for the entire dataset in\na single forward pass. Specifically, we employ a pre-trained Prior-Data Fitted\nTransformer Network (PFN) to perform clustering. The algorithm computes\nattention between the pre-clustered samples and the unclustered samples,\nallowing it to infer cluster assignments for the entire dataset based on the\nlearned relation. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that, given just\na few pre-clustered examples, the model can generalize to accurately cluster\nthe rest of the dataset. Experiments on challenging benchmark datasets show\nthat our approach can successfully cluster well-separated data without any\npre-clustered samples, and significantly improves performance when a few\nclustered samples are provided.

A promising direction for obtaining\nconditional dependence for conformal sets--in particular capturing\nheteroskedasticity--is through estimating the conditional density\n$\\mathbb{P}_{Y|X}$ and conformalizing its level sets. Previous work in this\nvein has focused on nonconformity scores based on the empirical cumulative\ndistribution function (CDF). Such scores are, however, computationally costly,\ntypically requiring expensive sampling methods. To avoid the need for sampling,\nwe observe that the CDF-based score reduces to a Mahalanobis distance in the\ncase of Gaussian scores, yielding a closed-form expression that can be directly\nconformalized. Moreover, the use of a Gaussian-based score opens the door to a\nnumber of extensions of the basic conformal method; in particular, we show how\nto construct conformal sets with missing output values, refine conformal sets\nas partial information about $Y$ becomes available, and construct conformal\nsets on transformations of the output space.
