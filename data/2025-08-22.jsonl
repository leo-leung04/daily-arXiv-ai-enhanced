Our model thus enables\nagents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the\nongoing dialogue.\n  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay\nbetween social interactions, steering, and crowding.

The layer-freezing technique\nhas recently attracted great attention as a promising method to effectively\nreduce the cost of network training. However, in traditional layer-freezing\nmethods, frozen layers are still required for forward propagation to generate\nfeature maps for unfrozen layers, limiting the reduction of computation costs.\nTo overcome this, prior works proposed a hypothetical solution, which caches\nfeature maps from frozen layers as a new dataset, allowing later layers to\ntrain directly on stored feature maps. While this approach appears to be\nstraightforward, it presents several major challenges that are severely\noverlooked by prior literature, such as how to effectively apply augmentations\nto feature maps and the substantial storage overhead introduced. If these\noverlooked challenges are not addressed, the performance of the caching method\nwill be severely impacted and even make it infeasible. This paper is the first\nto comprehensively explore these challenges and provides a systematic solution.\nTo improve training accuracy, we propose \\textit{similarity-aware channel\naugmentation}, which caches channels with high augmentation sensitivity with a\nminimum additional storage cost. To mitigate storage overhead, we incorporate\nlossy data compression into layer freezing and design a \\textit{progressive\ncompression} strategy, which increases compression rates as more layers are\nfrozen, effectively reducing storage costs. Finally, our solution achieves\nsignificant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with\na minor time overhead.

Notably,\neach behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction,\nor magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at\ninference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as\npositive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and\nrejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals.\nThis co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the\noutput space, characterized by well-separated response distributions\ncorresponding to each safety mode.

Methods that do\nprovide such guarantees, on the other hand, often face severe scalability\nlimitations when exploring the Pareto-optimal space.

This policy idling is often a reflection of the training data. For\ninstance, it can occur when the data contains small actions in areas where the\nrobot needs to perform high-precision motions, e.g., when preparing to grasp an\nobject or object insertion.

Neural simulators have\nemerged as a promising alternative to traditional analytical simulators,\ncapable of efficiently predicting complex dynamics and adapting to real-world\ndata; however, existing neural simulators typically require\napplication-specific training and fail to generalize to novel tasks and/or\nenvironments, primarily due to inadequate representations of the global state.\nIn this work, we address the problem of learning generalizable neural\nsimulators for robots that are structured as articulated rigid bodies. We\npropose NeRD (Neural Robot Dynamics), learned robot-specific dynamics models\nfor predicting future states for articulated rigid bodies under contact\nconstraints. NeRD uniquely replaces the low-level dynamics and contact solvers\nin an analytical simulator and employs a robot-centric and spatially-invariant\nsimulation state representation. We integrate the learned NeRD models as an\ninterchangeable backend solver within a state-of-the-art robotics simulator. We\nconduct extensive experiments to show that the NeRD simulators are stable and\naccurate over a thousand simulation steps; generalize across tasks and\nenvironment configurations; enable policy learning exclusively in a neural\nengine; and, unlike most classical simulators, can be fine-tuned from\nreal-world data to bridge the gap between simulation and reality."}

Traditional approaches treat these\ndimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated\nmethods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about\noptimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel\nframework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently\noptimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual\ngradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization\nby providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration\ninterdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that\nproposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an\nOptimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving\nfeedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT\ndemonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,\nachieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability."}

However, in real-world applications, users are often\npresented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where\nindependent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices\nand hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group\ninference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of\nsamples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment\nproblem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected\nto optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity\n(binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively\nprune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to\nscale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method\nsignificantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent\nsampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes\nacross a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image\nprompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple\noutputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples."}
